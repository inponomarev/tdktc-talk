== What do we want from tests?

[%step]
* Clean & neat
* Fast running
* Easy to write and maintain

== What do we want from tests?

* Clean & neat
* Fast running
* *Easy to write and maintain*

== The tech stack 

* RDBMS (PostgreSQL or others)
* Backend: Java/Kotlin + Spring Boot
* Restful API, frontend/other services: out of scope

== A very traditional architecture

== Approach #1: The Golden Dump

image::goldendump.jpg[]

== The Golden Dump Pros and Cons

[none]
[%step]
* image:thumbs-up.png[] A straighforward approach
* image:thumbs-down.png[] Fragile: init script can significantly diverge from the actual schema

== The Golden Dump Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:thumbs-down.png[] Obscure: what does this mean?

[source,sql]
----
insert into talkspeakers (talkid, speakerid) values (1001, 1004);
insert into talkspeakers (talkid, speakerid) values (1002, 1002);
insert into talkspeakers (talkid, speakerid) values (1002, 1003);
----

== The Golden Dump Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:thumbs-down.png[] Poor cohesion: tests rely on initialization script which is in a separate file far away.

Test setup relying on the script:
[source,java]
----
//A talk with a feedback
int id = 1001;
//A talk without a feedback
int id = 1002;
----

== The Golden Dump Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:thumbs-down.png[] Poor cohesion: tests rely on initialization script which is in a separate file far away.

Assertions relying on the script:
[source,java]
----
assertThat(talk.getName()).isEqualTo(
        "Reactive, or not reactive: that is the question");
assertThat(talk.getSpeakers().stream().map(Speaker::getName))
        .containsExactlyInAnyOrder("Evgeny Borisov", "Kirill Tolkachev");
assertThat(talk.getStatus()).isEqualTo(IN_REVIEW);
----

== The Golden Dump Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:thumbs-down.png[] Might be easy to write for the fist time, but time consuming to maintain.

== Let's count LOC

== Approach #2: Object Mother

image::objectmother.jpg[]

== Object Mother Pros and Cons

[none]
[%step]
* image:thumbs-up.png[] No SQL scripts, total decoupling from  schema migrations.
* image:thumbs-up.png[]  Type safe!

== Object Mother Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:thumbs-up.png[]  Good cohesion: you can give your fixtures the meaningful names, it's easy to understand what you test.

[source,java]
----
service.changeStatus(
    talkWithFeedback().getId(), 
    Status.REJECTED);
----

== Object Mother Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:shrug.png[] We have to pre-fill database with objects before the tests 
** image:index_up.png[]  We use our own DAOs
** image:index_up.png[]  We have to care about cleaning up the database after each test +
(which is ok, but can be slow)

== Object Mother Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:thumbs-down.png[] It's relatively easy to maintain ObjectMother class (thanks to type safety), +
but "inventing" objects with all their attributes can be difficult

== Approach #3: synthesized data

image::tdk.jpg[]

== Synthesized Data Pros and Cons

[none]
* image:thumbs-up.png[]image:thumbs-up.png[]image:thumbs-up.png[] We are using all the benefits of Object Mother approach, and
** image:thumbs-up.png[] no need to "invent" test examples
** image:thumbs-up.png[] no need to pre-fill the database using our own DAOs

== Synthesized Data Pros and Cons
[none]
[%step]
* image:shrug.png[]  We have to provide the config for TDK, but it's less prone to changes.
* image:thumbs-down.png[] Little or no control for what's actually in your database, we have to modify values occasionally using our DAO
